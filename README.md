# Group project to create a printf

## printf is a standard C library function used to print formatted output to the console or a file. 

It is part of the standard I/O library in C and is included in the stdio.h header file.In printf, format specifiers are used to format and print various types of data. A format specifier starts with the % character and is followed by a conversion character that specifies the type of data to be printed. 

### Here are some commonly used format specifiers in printf:

1. %d or %i: Integer
2. %f: Floating-point number
3. %c: Character
4. %s: String
5. %p: Pointer
5. %o: Octal number
6. %x or %X: Hexadecimal number
7. %e or %E: Scientific notation
8. %u: Unsigned integer

You can also use flags, field width, and precision specifiers to further customize the formatting of your output. Here are some examples:

1. %10d: Prints an integer in a field of width 10 characters
2. %.2f: Prints a floating-point number with 2 digits after the decimal point
3. %#x: Prints a hexadecimal number with a "0x" prefix

In this project we will not be creating the printf from scratch as that would require a lot of time and dedication but we will use the c language's printf to modify our codes. 

This group project was assigned to us by ALX Africa as a class project and I was partnered by Raphael Ogola, though, he seems to have been ill and won't take part in the project. As a result I shall my best to complete the project.
